# Email-Spam-Detection-in-Python
This project is a Machine Learning-based Email Spam Detection System that classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam. It uses basic NLP techniques for text preprocessing and a NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier for classification. A simple Streamlit web app is included for real-time message validation.

ðŸ”¹ Features:
Loads and cleans the Email Spam dataset.
Uses CountVectorizer (Bag of Words with stopword removal) for feature extraction.
Trains a Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes model to classify spam emails.
Provides an interactive Streamlit UI for testing email messages.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
Python
1.pandas â€“ For loading and preprocessing the dataset (pd.read_csv, .drop_duplicates, .rename, etc.).
2.scikit-learn (sklearn)
a)train_test_split â€“ To split dataset into training and testing sets.
b)CountVectorizer â€“ To convert text messages into a numerical matrix (Bag of Words representation).
c)MultinomialNB â€“ NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier for training the spam detection model.
3.streamlit â€“ To create a simple interactive web app where the user can input a message and check if itâ€™s spam or not.

ðŸ”¹ NLP Usage
This project applies NLP at a basic level using Bag of Words with stopword removal to transform raw email text into numerical features for classification.
